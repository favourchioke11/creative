            <h3>web design trends</h3>
            <p>
            I strive two things in design: "Simplicity and Clarity". Great designs are born out of this two things.
            Again, a user interface is like a joke if you have to explain it, it's not that good. <br>
            <br>
            Have no fear of perfection you will never reach it.There's a always a room for improvement; therefore,if it
            seems u are trying to perfect something, it is time to stop and and enjoy the result since it already
            deserves admiration. <br>
            <br>
            If you think math is hard, try web design.The harsh truth to be a designer requires special skills and
            unique visions to combine primitive shapes and primary colours a create a true masterpiece and meaning and
            emotions.
